                Hi, this is Sarika Ghimire. I am a Computer Science undergraduate student from Pokhara. 
                <br />
                <br />
                In tech, I would introduce myself as a frontend developer pursuing full stack development based on JavaScript. I learn about secure web development as well.
                <br />
                <br />
                I love attending events, workshops and conferences as well as organizing them. I like learning and growing in a team and community. I love reading fictional and non-fictional books.
